# Facebook-Online-Notifier

Clone this repo

Load this unpackaged extension in chrome

Type in the name you what to get notified about.

That's It!!!  :-)


Work To Be Done
1. Name is taken at the time of extension reload, find a way to change name without reload.
2. Only one name can be taken care of, try to make an array of names to look after.
